tig-2.2
-------

Incompatibilities:

 - Note that all user-defined commands are now executed at the repository root
   instead of whatever subdirectory Tig was started in. (GH #412)
 - Remove `cmdline-args` option to avoid problems where setting it in `~/.tigrc`
   potentially breaks other views due to its "context-sensitive" nature, where
   a `git-log` option maybe cause `git-grep` to fail. (GH #431)

Improvements:

 - Respect the XDG standard for configuration files. (GH #513)
 - Show tracking information in `tig status` (GH #504)
 - Resolve diff paths when `diff.noprefix` is true. (GH #487, #488)

 - Add `%(lineno)` state variable. (GH #304)
 - Use hash table to speed up refs lookup. (GH #350)
 - Show the file path in the blob view when available.
 - Use `set commit-order = default` to use Git's default commit order, even when
   the commit graph is enabled. The option will turn off automatic enabling of
   `--topo-order` when the graph is shown in the main view. (GH #310, #324)
 - Speed up the diff view in large repos by loading git-describe info after the
   diff content has been read. (GH #324)

 - Make blame commit ID colors stable across reloads. (GH #303)
 - Increase blame ID and graph rendering color palette to 14 colors.
 - New setting 'split-view-width' controls the width for vertical splits. It
   takes the width of the right-most view either as a number or a percentage.

   and `cmdline-args`. They are mainly intended for testing purposes but also
   allows to change the filtering arguments dynamically. (GH #306)
 - Add `log-options` setting for specifying default log view options.
   Example: `set log-options = --pretty=fuller`.
 - Use option specific view flags to reload view after `:set` commands.

Bug fixes:

   to use the `medium` format. (GH #225)
 - Fix invocation of git-diff for the blame view's line tracking. (GH #316)
 - Fix blame completion of directory names. (GH #317)
 - Fix display of conflicts in the main view when 'show-changes' is enabled.

tig-2.0
-------

Note to packagers:

 - Add `.adoc` extension to AsciiDoc files so they show correctly on GitHub.
   This includes `README`, `INSTALL`, and `NEWS` and files in `doc/` directory.
 - `BUGS` file has been merged into `README.adoc`.
 - Default keybindings have been moved to a system-level `tigrc` file, which is
   installed to ${sysconfdir} by default. The content of the `tigrc` file is
   included inside the binary as a fall-back. Pass `NO_BUILTIN_TIGRC=y` to not
   include the system `tigrc` content and reduce the size of the binary.
 - The example `contrib/tigrc` file (made obsolete by `tigrc`) has been removed.
 - Source files have been moved to `src` and `include` and `tig.c` was split up.
 - Build output is less verbose by default; use `make V=1` for old output.

Incompatibilities:

 - In preparation for key combo support, key mappings for symbolic keys (e.g.
   `Up` and `Down`) must now start with `<` and end with `>`, e.g. `<Up>` and
   `<Down>`. Furthermore, escape key combos must now use `<Esc>key` instead of
   `^[key`, and control key mappings must now use `<Ctrl-key>` instead of
   `^key`.
 - Only use 'diff-options' for the diff view and introduce '%(cmdlineargs)' to
   hold non-file and non-revision flags passed on the command line. Affects all
   user-defined commands that expect '%(diffargs)' to hold both 'diff-options'
   arguments and those passed on the command line. (GH #228)
 - Remove built-in keybinding for `git gc`. Add the following line to `~/.tigrc`
   to restore it: `bind generic G ?git gc`.
 - To support view specific colors, '.' can no longer be used interchangeably
   with '-' and '_' in settings names and in particular color names.
 - Replace 'stage-next' action with prompt command using a predefined search
   (see below) and add binding (`@` by default) to also work in the diff view.
 - Most view display options must now be set via the new `*-view` options in
   tigrc. Existing options are no longer recognized, but a warning is shown.
 - Remap default bindings to have more consistent convention: use lower-case
   keys primarily for view switching and non-destructive actions, use upper-case
   keys for view-specific actions including user-defined commands. To preserve
   old default key bindings see `contrib/bindings-v1.x.tigrc`. (GH #257)

Improvements:

 - Add mouse support: scroll view, click line to move cursor, double click line
   (or click again) to "Enter" cursor line, e.g. open commit diff. Disabled by
   default, since it makes text selection less intuitive. If you enable this
   remember to hold down Shift (or Option on Mac) when selecting text.
 - Rewrite and improve the rendering of the commit graph. (GH #144, #46)
 - Add completion and history support to the prompt via readline. (GH #185)
 - Options can be configured and toggled individually for each view. Use the new
   view settings to configure the order and display options for each view
   columns. See system tigrc and tigrc(5) for examples. (GH #89, #222)
 - Add grep view as a front-end to git-grep(1): `tig grep -p strchr`. From
   within Tig, the key for switching or grepping is bound to 'g' by default.
 - Rename 'branch' view to 'refs' view and show tags. (GH #134)
 - Add main view pager mode that reads git-log's '--pretty=raw' data
   from stdin, e.g. `git reflog --pretty=raw | tig --pretty=raw`.
 - Add support for `--graph` and highlight diff stats in the log view.
 - Add default command bindings: `!` to delete branch, `!` to drop stash.
 - Add 'stage-split-chunk' action for splitting chunks in the stage view.
   Bound to '\' by default. (GH #107)
 - Add 'back' action bound to '<' by default, which will return the blame view
   to the previous revision and line after moving e.g. to the parent. (GH #124)
 - Auto-refresh views based on watched repository changes. Configure by setting
   `refresh-mode` to 'manual', 'auto', 'after-command', or 'periodic'. (GH #190)
 - All default settings are in well-documented system `tigrc`.
 - Add `:toggle` prompt command to manipulate options using keybindings. For
   example: `bind diff D :toggle diff-options --patience --notes`. (GH #69)
 - Add a new "auto" value for the 'vertical-split' option to let Tig choose the
   split orientation (this is the new default behavior). Can be toggled.
 - Make it possible to toggle the display of files in untracked directories.
 - Allow Tig to be started with no default configuration by specifying an
   alternative system `tigrc` file, e.g.: `TIGRC_SYSTEM=~/.tigrc.safe tig`. Set
   `TIGRC_SYSTEM` to the empty string to use built-in configuration instead of
 - Key mappings can contain UTF-8 multibyte unicode keys.
 - Warn about conflicting keybindings using Ctrl, e.g. `<Ctrl-f>` and
   `<Ctrl-F>`. (GH #218)
 - Extend key bindings for prompt commands (ie. `bind <keymap> <key> :<prompt>`)
   to support predefined searches, eg.: `bind stage 2 :?^@@`.
 - Git color mappings can be configured in tigrc.
 - More informative configuration error messages.
 - Make reference label formatting configurable, for example:
   `set reference-format = (branch) <tags> remote`. (GH #201)
 - Adjust author width and other view columns automatically. (GH #49)
 - Support view specific colors: `color stage.diff-add yellow default`.
 - Copy `-S`, `-G` and `--grep=` pattern to search buffer so 'find-next' and
   'find-prev' work as expected.
 - Optionally specify custom prompt for `%(prompt)` in shell commands, e.g.
   `bind main B ?git checkout -b "%(prompt Enter new branch name: )"`.
 - Add `%(remote)` and `%(tag)` symbols to complement `%(branch)`.
 - User-defined commands can now be prefixed with any of the supported flags,
   e.g. `?git checkout -b %(branch)`.
 - Open editor at line number for combined diffs e.g. diffs of unmerged files.
 - Add build configuration for Cygwin (OS name: CYGWIN_NT-6.1). (GH #92)
 - Document the Git commands supported by the pager mode.  (GH #1)
   system `tigrc` configuration. (GH #235)

Bug fixes:

 - Fix stash diff display when reloading the stash view after a deleting.
 - Set the commit reference when opening the blame view from the blob view.
 - Correctly identify and highlight the remote branch tracked by HEAD.
 - Pass --no-color after user defined arguments to ensure that colors do not
   break the output parsing. (GH #191)
 - Close stdin when pager mode is not supported.
 - Show newly created branches in the main view. (GH #196)
 - File with 0 changes breaks diffstat highlighting (GH #215)
 - Update %(branch) variable in the main view. (GH #223)
 - Disable graph rendering when either of `--reverse`, `-S`, `-G`, and `--grep`
   are passed to the main view. (GH #127)
 - Only refresh views that support it.
 - Fix author and date annotation of renamed entries in the tree view.
 - Fix use of unsafe methods in the signal handler. (GH #245)
 - Fix rendering in non-UTF8 terminals.
 - Fix stage-update-line by rewriting the diff chunk containing the line instead
   of using `--unidiff-zero` and a diff context of zero. (GH #130)
 - Fix status-update to work for untracked directories. (GH #236)
 - Don't pass log parameters given on the command line to the diff view.

tig-1.2.1
---------

 - Move manual and man pages to doc/ directory and rename AsciiDoc files
   to have .asciidoc as the extension to make them render on GitHub.

   prefixes. Example: `set show-file-size = units`. (GH #163)
 - Reduce main view memory usage and startup time, especially when revision
   graph rendering is disabled. (GH #160)

Bug fixes:

 - Fix submodule-related setup to check for non-zero return value from
   setenv(). (GH #188)

tig-1.2
-------

 - Tig now has its own tag on Stack Overflow, where users are invited to

   by adding `set editor-line-number = no` to ~/.tigrc. (GH #118, #119)
 - Add toggle-files to control whether to show full commit diff or only
   the diff concerning the currently selected file, e.g. for blame.
 - Optionally highlight exceeding characters in long commit titles.
   The default title max width is 50 characters. Customize using:

tig-1.1
-------

Incompatibilities:

 - Values set for author-width and filename-width will result in widths
   one character bigger than previously.

Improvements:

   being installed.

Improvements:

 - Provide the manual as a man page named tigmanual(7).
 - Add ability to toggle between showing shorter dates (without time
   info) and relative dates. Use 'D' to toggle between date formats.
