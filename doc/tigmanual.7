.SH "NAME"
tigmanual \- text\-mode interface for Git
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
tig        [options] [revisions] [\-\-] [paths]
tig show   [options] [revisions] [\-\-] [paths]
tig blame  [options] [rev] [\-\-] path

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This is the manual for Tig, the ncurses\-based text\-mode interface for git\&. Tig allows you to browse changes in a Git repository and can additionally act as a pager for output of various Git commands\&. When used as a pager, it will display input from stdin and colorize it\&.
.sp
When browsing repositories, Tig uses the underlying Git commands to present the user with various views, such as summarized commit log and showing the commit with the log message, diffstat, and the diff\&.
.SH "CALLING CONVENTIONS"
.SS "Pager Mode"
.sp
If stdin is a pipe, any log or diff options will be ignored and the pager view will be opened loading data from stdin\&. The pager mode can be used for colorizing output from various Git commands\&.
.sp
Example on how to colorize the output of git\-show(1):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git show | tig
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SS "Git Command Options"
.sp
All Git command options specified on the command line will be passed to the given command and all will be shell quoted before they are passed to the shell\&.
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
.sp
If you specify options for the main view, you should not use the \-\-pretty option as this option will be set automatically to the format expected by the main view\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.sp
Example on how to view a commit and show both author and committer information:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ tig show \-\-pretty=fuller
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
See the section on specifying revisions for an introduction to revision options supported by the Git commands\&. For details on specific Git command options, refer to the man page of the command in question\&.
.SH "THE VIEWER"
.sp
The display consists of a status window on the last line of the screen and one or more views\&. The default is to only show one view at a time but it is possible to split both the main and log view to also show the commit diff\&.
.sp
If you are in the log view and press \fIEnter\fR when the current line is a commit line, such as:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
commit 4d55caff4cc89335192f3e566004b4ceef572521
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
You will split the view so that the log view is displayed in the top window and the diff view in the bottom window\&. You can switch between the two views by pressing \fITab\fR\&. To maximize the log view again, simply press \fIl\fR\&.
.SS "Views"
.sp
Various \fIviews\fR of a repository are presented\&. Each view is based on output from an external command, most often \fIgit log\fR, \fIgit diff\fR, or \fIgit show\fR\&.
.PP
The main view
.RS 4
Is the default view, and it shows a one line summary of each commit in the chosen list of revisions\&. The summary includes committer date or author date, author, and the first line of the log message\&. Additionally, any repository references, such as tags, will be shown\&.
.RE
.PP
The log view
.RS 4
Presents a more rich view of the revision log showing the whole log message and the diffstat\&.
.RE
.PP
The reflog view
.RS 4
Presents a view of the reflog allowing to navigate the repo history\&.
.RE
.PP
The diff view
.RS 4
Shows either the diff of the current working tree, that is, what has changed since the last commit, or the commit diff complete with log message, diffstat and diff\&.
.RE
.PP
The tree view
.RS 4
Lists directory trees associated with the current revision allowing subdirectories to be descended or ascended and file blobs to be viewed\&.
.RE
.PP
The blob view
.RS 4
Displays the file content or "blob" of data associated with a file name\&.
.RE
.PP
The blame view
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
The stage view
.RS 4
Displays diff changes for staged or unstaged files being tracked or file content of untracked files\&.
.RE
.PP
The stash view
.RS 4
Displays the list of stashes in the repository\&.
.RE
.PP
The grep view
.RS 4
Displays a list of files and all the lines that matches a search pattern\&.
.RE
.PP
The pager view
.RS 4
Is used for displaying both input from stdin and output from Git commands entered in the internal prompt\&.
.RE
.PP
The help view
.RS 4
Displays a quick reference of key bindings\&.
.RE
.SS "Browsing State and User\-defined Commands"
.sp
The viewer keeps track of both what head and commit ID you are currently viewing\&. The commit ID will follow the cursor line and change every time you highlight a different commit\&. Whenever you reopen the diff view it will be reloaded, if the commit ID changed\&. The head ID is used when opening the main and log view to indicate from what revision to show history\&.
.sp
Some of the commands used or provided by Tig can be configured\&. This goes for some of the environment variables as well as the external commands\&. These user\-defined commands can use arguments that refer to the current browsing state by using one of the following variables\&.
.sp

.sp
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.sp
Several options related to the interface with Git can be configured via environment options\&.
.SS "Configuration Files"
.sp
Upon startup, Tig first reads the system wide configuration file ({sysconfdir}/tigrc by default) and then proceeds to read the user\(cqs configuration file (~/\&.tigrc or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tig/config by default)\&. The paths to either of these files can be overridden through the following environment variables:
.PP
TIGRC_USER
.RS 4
Path of the user configuration file\&.
.RE
.PP
TIGRC_SYSTEM
.RS 4
Path of the system wide configuration file\&.
.RE
.SS "History Files"
.sp
If compiled with readline support, Tig writes a persistent command and search history to ~/\&.tig_history or $XDG_DATA_HOME/tig/history\&.
.SS "Repository References"
.sp
Commits that are referenced by tags and branch heads will be marked by the reference name surrounded by \fI[\fR and \fI]\fR:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
2006\-03\-26 19:42 Petr Baudis         | [cogito\-0\&.17\&.1] Cogito 0\&.17\&.1
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
If you want to limit what branches are shown, say only show branches named master or those which start with the feature/ prefix, you can do it by setting the following variable:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ TIG_LS_REMOTE="git ls\-remote \&. master feature/*" tig
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Or set the variable permanently in your environment\&.
.PP
TIG_LS_REMOTE
.RS 4
Command for retrieving all repository references\&. The command should output data in the same format as git\-ls\-remote(1)\&. Defaults to:
.RE
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git ls\-remote \&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SS "Diff options"
.sp
It is possible to alter how diffs are shown by the diff view\&. If for example you prefer to have commit and author dates shown as relative dates, use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ TIG_DIFF_OPTS="\-\-relative\-date" tig
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp

For more custom needs, external commands provide a way to easily execute a script or program\&. They are bound to keys and use information from the current browsing state, such as the current commit ID\&. Tig comes with the following built\-in external commands:

.SH "REVISION SPECIFICATION"
.sp
This section describes various ways to specify what revisions to display or otherwise limit the view to\&. Tig does not itself parse the described revision options so refer to the relevant Git man pages for further information\&. Relevant man pages besides git\-log(1) are git\-diff(1) and git\-rev\-list(1)\&.
.sp
You can tune the interaction with Git by making use of the options explained in this section\&. For example, by configuring the environment variable described in the section on diff options\&.
.SS "Limit by Path Name"
.sp
If you are interested only in those revisions that made changes to a specific file (or even several files) list the files like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ tig Makefile README
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
To avoid ambiguity with Tig\(cqs subcommands or repository references such as tag names, be sure to separate file names from other Git options using "\-\-"\&. So if you have a file named \fIstatus\fR it will clash with the \fIstatus\fR subcommand, and thus you will have to use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ tig \-\- status
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SS "Limit by Date or Number"
.sp
To speed up interaction with Git, you can limit the amount of commits to show both for the log and main view\&. Either limit by date using e\&.g\&. \-\-since=1\&.month or limit by the number of commits using \-n400\&.
.sp
If you are only interested in changes that happened between two dates you can use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ tig \-\-after="May 5th" \-\-before="2006\-05\-16 15:44"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
.sp
If you want to avoid having to quote dates containing spaces you can use "\&." instead, e\&.g\&. \-\-after=May\&.5th\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.SS "Limiting by Commit Ranges"
.sp
Alternatively, commits can be limited to a specific range, such as "all commits between \fItag\-1\&.0\fR and \fItag\-2\&.0\fR"\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ tig tag\-1\&.0\&.\&.tag\-2\&.0
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
This way of commit limiting makes it trivial to only browse the commits which haven\(cqt been pushed to a remote branch\&. Assuming \fIorigin\fR is your upstream remote branch, using:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ tig origin\&.\&.HEAD
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
will list what will be pushed to the remote branch\&. Optionally, the ending \fIHEAD\fR can be left out since it is implied\&.
.SS "Limiting by Reachability"
.sp
Git interprets the range specifier "tag\-1\&.0\&.\&.tag\-2\&.0" as "all commits reachable from \fItag\-2\&.0\fR but not from \fItag\-1\&.0\fR"\&. Where reachability refers to what commits are ancestors (or part of the history) of the branch or tagged revision in question\&.
.sp
If you prefer to specify which commit to preview in this way use the following:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ tig tag\-2\&.0 ^tag\-1\&.0
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
You can think of \fI^\fR as a negation operator\&. Using this alternate syntax, it is possible to further prune commits by specifying multiple branch cut offs\&.
.SS "Combining Revisions Specification"
.sp
Revision options can to some degree be combined, which makes it possible to say "show at most 20 commits from within the last month that changed files under the Documentation/ directory\&."
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ tig \-\-since=1\&.month \-n20 \-\- Documentation/
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SS "Examining All Repository References"
.sp
In some cases, it can be useful to query changes across all references in a repository\&. An example is to ask "did any line of development in this repository change a particular file within the last week"\&. This can be accomplished using:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ tig \-\-all \-\-since=1\&.week \-\- Makefile
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
