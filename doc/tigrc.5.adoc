NAME
----
tigrc - Tig configuration file


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
_______________________________________________________________________
*set*   'variable' *=* 'value'
*bind*  'keymap' 'key' 'action'
*color* 'area' 'fgcolor' 'bgcolor' '[attributes]'
*source* 'path'
_______________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
-----------

You can permanently set an option by putting it in the `~/.tigrc` file.  The
file consists of a series of 'commands'.  Each line of the file may contain
only one command.  Commands can span multiple lines if each line is
terminated by a backslash ('\') character. 

The hash mark ('#') is used as a 'comment' character. All text after the
comment character to the end of the line is ignored. You can use comments to
annotate your initialization file.

Git configuration
-----------------

Alternatively to using `~/.tigrc`, Tig options can be set by putting them in
one of the Git configuration files, which are read by Tig on startup. See
'git-config(1)' for which files to use. The following example show the basic
syntax to use for settings, bindings and colors.

// TEST: gitconfig
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[tig] show-changes = true
[tig "color"] cursor = yellow red bold 
[tig "bind"] generic = P parent
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to tig-specific options, the following Git options are read from
the Git configuration:

'color.*'::

	Colors for the various UI types. Can be configured via the 'git-colors'
	setting.

'core.abbrev'::

	The width of the commit ID. See also 'id-width' option.

'core.editor'::

	The editor command. Can be overridden by setting GIT_EDITOR.

'core.worktree'::

	The path to the root of the working tree.

'gui.encoding'::

	The encoding to use for displaying of file content.

'i18n.commitencoding'::

	The encoding used for commits. The default is UTF-8.

Set command
-----------

A few selective variables can be configured via the set command. The syntax
is:

[verse]
*set* variables *=* value

Examples:

// TEST: tigrc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
set commit-order = topo		# Order commits topologically
set git-colors = no		# Do not read Git's color settings.
set horizontal-scroll = 33%	# Scroll 33% of the view width
set blame-options = -C -C -C	# Blame lines from other files

# Wrap branch names with () and tags with <>
set reference-format = (branch) <tag>

# Configure blame view columns using command spanning multiple lines.
set blame-view = \
	date:default \
	author:abbreviated \
	file-name:auto \
	id:yes,color \
	line-number:yes,interval=5 text
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Or in the Git configuration files:

// TEST: gitconfig
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[tig]
	line-graphics = no	# Disable graphics characters
	tab-size = 8		# Number of spaces per tab
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The type of variables is either bool, int, string, or mixed.

Valid bool values::

	To set a bool variable to true use either "1", "true", or "yes".
	Any other value will set the variable to false.

Valid int values::

	A non-negative integer.

Valid string values::

	A string of characters. Optionally, use either ' or " as delimiters.

Valid mixed values::

	These values are composites of the above types. The valid values are
	specified in the description.

Variables
~~~~~~~~~

The following variables can be set:

'diff-options' (string)::

	A space separated string of diff options to use in the diff view.
	git-show(1) is used for formatting and always passes --patch-with-stat.
	This option overrides any options specified in the TIG_DIFF_OPTS
	environment variable (described in manpage:tig[1]), but is itself
	overridden by diff flags given on the command line invocation.

'blame-options' (string)::

	A space separated string of extra blame options. Can be used for
	telling git-blame(1) how to detect the origin of lines. The value
	is ignored when Tig is started in blame mode and given blame options
	on the command line.

'reference-format' (string)::

	A space separated string of format strings used for formatting reference
	names. Wrap the name of the reference type with the characters you would
	like to use for formatting, e.g. `[tag]` and `<remote>`. If no format is
	specified for `local-tag`, the format for `tag` is used. Similarly, if no
	format is specified for `tracked-remote` the `remote` format is used.
	Prefix with `hide:` to not show that reference type, e.g. `hide:remote`.
	Supported reference types are:
	 - head			: The current HEAD.
	 - tag			: A signed tag.
	 - local-tag		: An unsigned tag.
	 - remote		: A remote.
	 - tracked-remote	: The remote tracked by current HEAD.
	 - replace		: A replaced reference.
	 - branch		: Any other reference.

'line-graphics' (mixed) [ascii|default|utf-8|<bool>]::

	What type of character graphics for line drawing.

'horizontal-scroll' (mixed)::

	Interval to scroll horizontally in each step. Can be specified either
	as the number of columns, e.g. '5', or as a percentage of the view
	width, e.g. '33%', where the maximum is 100%. For percentages it is
	always ensured that at least one column is scrolled. The default is to
	scroll '50%' of the view width.

'git-colors' (list)::

	A space separated list of "key=value" pairs where the key is a Git color
	name and the value is a Tig color name, e.g. "branch.current=main-head"
	and "grep.filename=grep.file". Set to "no" to disable.

'show-notes' (mixed) [<reference>|<bool>]::

	Whether to show notes for a commit. When set to a note reference the
	reference is passed to `git show --notes=`. Notes are enabled by
	default.

'show-changes' (bool)::

	Whether to show staged and unstaged changes in the main view.

'vertical-split' (mixed) [auto|<bool>]::

	Whether to split the view horizontally or vertically.
	"auto" (which is the default) means that it will depend on the window
	dimensions. When true vertical orientation is used, and false sets the
	orientation to horizontal.

'split-view-height' (mixed)::

	The height of the bottom view in a horizontally split display. Can be
	specified either as the number of rows, e.g. '5', or as a percentage of
	the view height, e.g. '80%', where the maximum is 100%. It is always
	ensured that the smaller of the views is at least four rows high. The
	default is '67%'.

'split-view-width' (mixed)::

	Width of the right-most view in a vertically split display. Can be
	specified either as the number of column, e.g. '5', or as a percentage
	of the view width, e.g. '80%', where the maximum is 100%. It is always
	ensured that the smaller of the views is at least four columns wide. The
	default is '50%'.

'status-untracked-dirs' (bool)::

	Show untracked directories contents in the status view (analog to
	`git ls-files --directory` option). On by default.

'tab-size' (int)::

	Number of spaces per tab. The default is 8 spaces.

'diff-context' (int)::

	Number of context lines to show for diffs.

'ignore-space' (mixed) [no|all|some|at-eol|<bool>]::

	Ignore space changes in diff view. By default no space changes are
	ignored. Changing this to "all", "some" or "at-eol" is equivalent to
	passing "--ignore-all-space", "--ignore-space" or
	"--ignore-space-at-eol" respectively to `git diff` or `git show`.

'commit-order' (mixed) [default|topo|date|author-date|reverse|<bool>]::

	Commit ordering using the default (chronological reverse) order,
	topological order, date order or reverse order. The default order is
	used when the option is set to false, and topo order when set to true.
	Note that topological order is automatically used in the main view when
	the commit graph is enabled and the commit order is set to the default.

'ignore-case' (bool)::

	Ignore case in searches. By default, the search is case sensitive.

'wrap-lines' (bool)::

	Wrap long lines. By default, lines are not wrapped.
	Not compatible with line numbers enabled.

'focus-child' (bool)::

	Whether to focus the child view when it is opened. When disabled the
	focus will remain in the parent view, avoiding reloads of the child
	view when navigating the parent view. True by default.

'editor-line-number' (bool)::

	Whether to pass the selected line number to the editor command. The
	line number is passed as `+<line-number>` in front of the file name.
	Example: `vim +10 tig.c`

'mouse' (bool)::

	Whether to enable mouse support. Off by default since it makes selecting
	text from the terminal less intuitive. When enabled hold down Shift (or
	Option on Mac) to select text. Mouse support requires that ncurses
	itself support mouse events.

'mouse-scroll' (int)::

	Interval to scroll up or down using the mouse. The default is 3 lines.
	Mouse support requires that ncurses itself support mouse events and that
	you have enabled mouse support in ~/.tigrc with `set mouse = true`.

'refresh-mode' (mixed) [manual|auto|after-command|periodic|<bool>]::

	Configures how views are refreshed based on modifications to watched
	files in the repository. When set to 'manual', nothing is refreshed
	automatically. When set to 'auto', views are refreshed when a
	modification is detected. When set to 'after-command' only refresh after
	returning from an external command. When set to 'periodic', visible
	views are refreshed periodically using 'refresh-interval'.

'refresh-interval' (int)::

	Interval in seconds between view refresh update checks when
	'refresh-mode' is set to 'periodic'.

'file-args' (args)::

	Command line arguments referring to files. These are filtered using
	`git-rev-parse(1)`.

'rev-args' (args)::

	Command line arguments referring to revisions. These are filtered using
	`git-rev-parse(1)`.

'cmdline-args' (args)::

	All remaining command line arguments that are not either filtered into
	'file-args' or 'rev-args'.

View settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The view settings define the order and options for the different columns of a
view. Each view setting expects a space separated list of column specifications.
Column specifications starts with the column type, and can optionally be
followed by a colon (`:`) and a list of column options. E.g. the following
column specification defines an 'author' column displaying the author email and
with a maximum width of 20 characters: `author:email,width=20`.

The first option value in a column specification is always the 'display' option.
When no 'display' value is given, 'yes' is assumed. For 'display' options
expecting an enumerated value this will automatically resolve to the default
enum value. For example, `file-name` will automatically have its 'display'
setting resolve to 'auto'.

Examples:
// TEST: tigrc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Enable both ID and line numbers in the blame view
set blame-view = date:default author:full file-name:auto id:yes,color \
		 line-number:yes,interval=5 text

# Change grep view to be similar to `git grep` format
set grep-view = file-name:yes line-number:yes,interval=1 text

# Show file sizes as units
set tree-view = line-number:no,interval=5 mode author:full \
		file-size:units date:default id:no file-name

# Show line numbers for every 10th line in the pager view
set pager-view = line-number:yes,interval=10 text
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following list shows which the available view settings and what column types
they support:

blob-view, diff-view, log-view, pager-view, stage-view:: line-number, text
blame-view:: author, date, file-name, id, line-number, text
grep-view:: file-name, line-number, text
main-view:: author, date, commit-title, id, line-number
refs-view:: author, date, commit-title, id, line-number, ref
stash-view:: author, date, commit-title, id, line-number
status-view:: file-name, line-number, status
tree-view:: author, date, id, file-name, file-size, line-number, mode

Supported column types and their respective column options:

author::

	- 'display' (mixed) [full|abbreviated|email|email-user|<bool>]: How to
	  display author names. If set to "abbreviated" author initials will be
	  shown.
	- 'width' (int): Width of the column. When set to a value between 1 and
	  10, the author name will be abbreviated to the author's initials.
	  When set to zero, the width is automatically sized to fit the content.

commit-title::
	- 'graph' (bool): Whether to show revision graph in the main view on
	  start-up. See also the 'line-graphics' options.
	- 'refs' (bool): Whether to show references (branches, tags, and
	  remotes) in the main view. Can be toggled.
	- 'overflow' (bool or int): Whether to highlight text in commit titles
	  exceeding a given width. When set to a boolean, it enables or disables
	  the highlighting using the default width of 50 character. When set to
	  an int, the assigned value is used as the maximum character width.

date::
	- 'display' (mixed) [relative|short|default|local|<bool>]: How to
	  display dates. If set to "relative" a relative date will be used, e.g.
	  "2 minutes ago". If set to "short" no time information is shown.  If
	  set to "local", localtime(3) is used.
	- 'width' (int): Width of the column. When set to zero, the width is
	  automatically sized to fit the content.

file-name::
	- 'display' (mixed) [auto|always|<bool>]: When to display file names.
	  If set to "auto" file names are shown only when needed, e.g. when
	  running: tig blame -C <file>.
	- 'width' (int): Width of the column. When set to zero, the width is
	  automatically sized to fit the content.

file-size::
	- 'display' (mixed) [default|units|<bool>]: How to display file sizes.
	  When set to "units", sizes are shown using binary prefixes, e.g. 12524
	  bytes is shown as "12.2K".
	- 'width' (int): Width of the filename column. When set to zero, the
	  width is automatically sized to fit the content.

id::
	- 'display' (bool): Whether to show commit IDs in the main view.
	- 'width' (int) : Width of the commit ID. When unset Tig will use the
	  value of 'core.abbrev' if found. See git-config(1) on how to set
	  'core.abbrev'. When set to zero the width is automatically sized to
	  fit the content of reflog (e.g.  `ref/stash@{4}`) IDs and otherwise
	  default to 7.

line-number::
	- 'display' (bool): Whether to show line numbers.
	- 'interval' (int): Interval between line numbers.
	- 'width' (int): Width of the column. When set to zero, the width is
	  automatically sized to fit the content.

mode::
	- 'display' (bool): Whether to show file modes.
	- 'width' (int): Width of the column. When set to zero, the width is
	  automatically sized to fit the content.

ref::
	- 'display' (bool): Whether to show the reference name.
	- 'width' (int): Width of the column. When set to zero, the width is
	  automatically sized to fit the content.

status::
	- 'display' (mixed) [no|short|long|<bool>]: How to display the status
	  label.
	- 'width' (int): Width of the column. When set to zero, the width is
	  automatically sized to fit the content.

text::
	- 'commit-title-overflow' (bool or int): Whether to highlight commit
	  titles exceeding a given width in the diff view. When set to a
	  boolean, it enables or disables the highlighting using the default
	  width of 50 character. When set to an int, the assigned value is used
	  as the maximum character width.

All column options can be toggled. For 'display' options, use the
option name as the prefix followed by a dash and the column name. E.g.
`:toggle author-display` will toggle the 'display' option in the 'author'
column. For all other options use the column name followed by a dash and
then the option name as the suffix. E.g. `:toggle commit-title-graph`
will toggle the 'graph' option in the 'commit-title' column.

Bind command
------------

Using bind commands, keys can be mapped to an action when pressed in a given
key map. The syntax is:

[verse]
*bind* 'keymap' 'key' 'action'

Examples:
// TEST: tigrc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Add keybinding to quickly jump to the next diff chunk in the stage view
bind stage <Enter> :/^@@

# Disable the default mapping for running git-gc
bind generic G none

# User-defined external command to amend the last commit
bind status + !git commit --amend

# User-defined internal command that reloads ~/.tigrc
bind generic S :source ~/.tigrc

# UTF8-encoded characters can be used as key values.
bind generic ø @sh -c "printf '%s' %(commit) | pbcopy"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Or in the Git configuration files:
// TEST: gitconfig
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[tig "bind"]
	# 'unbind' the default quit key binding
	main = Q none
	# Cherry-pick current commit onto current branch
	generic = C !git cherry-pick %(commit)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keys are mapped by first searching the keybindings for the current view, then
the keybindings for the *generic* keymap, and last the default keybindings.
Thus, the view keybindings override the generic keybindings which override the
built-in keybindings.

--

Keymaps::

Valid keymaps are: *main*, *diff*, *log*, *help*, *pager*, *status*, *stage*,
*tree*, *blob*, *blame*, *refs*, *stash*, *grep* and *generic*. Use *generic*
to set key mapping in all keymaps.

Key values::

Key values should never be quoted. Use either an ASCII or UTF8-encoded character
or one of the following symbolic key names. Symbolic key names are case
insensitive and starts with "<" and ends with ">". Use *<Hash>* to bind to the
`#` key, since the hash mark is used as a comment character. Use *<LessThan>* to
bind to the `<` key.

*<Enter>*, *<Space>*, *<Backspace>*, *<Tab>*, *<Escape>* or *<Esc>*, *<Left>*,
*<Right>*, *<Up>*, *<Down>*, *<Insert>* or *<Ins>*, *<Delete>* or *<Del>*,
*<Hash>*, *<LessThan>* or *<LT>*, *<Home>*, *<End>*, *<PageUp>* or *<PgUp>*,
*<PageDown>* or *<PgDown>*, *<F1>*, *<F2>*, *<F3>*, *<F4>*, *<F5>*, *<F6>*,
*<F7>*, *<F8>*, *<F9>*, *<F10>*, *<F11>*, *<F12>*.

To define key mappings with the `Ctrl` key, use `<Ctrl-key>`. In addition, key
combos consisting of an initial `Escape` key followed by a normal key value can
be bound using `<Esc>key`.

Examples:
// TEST: tigrc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
bind main R		refresh
bind main <Down>	next
bind main <Ctrl-f>	scroll-page-down
bind main <Esc>o	options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that due to the way ncurses encodes `Ctrl` key mappings, `Ctrl-m` and
`Ctrl-i` cannot be bound as they conflict with 'Enter' and 'Tab' respectively.
Furthermore, ncurses does not allow to distinguish between `Ctrl-f` and
`Ctrl-F`. Finally, `Ctrl-z` is automatically used for process control and will
suspend Tig and open a subshell (use `fg` to reenter Tig).

Actions::

Actions are either specified as user-defined commands (external or internal) or
using action names as described in the following sections.

--

External user-defined command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These actions start with one or more of the following option flags followed by
the command that should be executed.

[frame="none",grid="none",cols="25<m,75<"]
|=============================================================================
|!			|Run the command in the foreground with output shown.
|@			|Run the command in the background with no output.
|?			|Prompt the user before executing the command.
|<			|Exit Tig after executing the command.
|=============================================================================

Unless otherwise specified, commands are run in the foreground with their
console output shown (as if '!' was specified). When multiple command options
are specified their behavior are combined, e.g. "?<git commit" will prompt the
user whether to execute the command and will exit Tig after completion.

Browsing state variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

User-defined commands can optionally refer to Tig's internal state using the
following variable names, which are substituted before commands are run:

[frame="none",grid="none",cols="25<m,75<"]
|=============================================================================
|%(head)		|The currently viewed 'head' ID. Defaults to HEAD
|%(commit)		|The currently selected commit ID.
|%(blob)		|The currently selected blob ID.
|%(branch)		|The currently selected branch name.
|%(remote)		|The currently selected remote name. For remote
			 branches %(branch) will contain the branch name.
|%(tag)			|The currently selected tag name.
|%(stash)		|The currently selected stash name.
|%(directory)		|The current directory path in the tree view or
			 "." if undefined.
|%(file)		|The currently selected file.
|%(ref)			|The reference given to blame or HEAD if undefined.
|%(revargs)		|The revision arguments passed on the command line.
|%(fileargs)		|The file arguments passed on the command line.
|%(cmdlineargs)		|All other options passed on the command line.
|%(diffargs)		|The diff options from 'diff-options' or 'TIG_DIFF_OPTS'
|%(prompt)		|Prompt for the argument value. Optionally specify a
			 custom prompt using `"%(prompt Enter branch name: )"`
|=============================================================================

Examples:
// TEST: tigrc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Save save the current commit as a patch file when the user selects a
# commit in the main view and presses 'S'.
bind main S !git format-patch -1 %(commit)

# Create and checkout a new branch; specify custom prompt
bind main B ?git checkout -b "%(prompt Enter new branch name: )"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced shell-like commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your command requires use of dynamic features, such as subshells,
expansion of environment variables and process control, this can be achieved by
using a shell command:

.Configure a binding to copy the current commit ID to the clipboard.
// TEST: tigrc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
bind generic I @sh -c "echo -n %(commit) | xclip -selection c"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Or by using a combination of Git aliases and Tig external commands. The
following example entries can be put in either the .gitconfig or .git/config
file:

.Git configuration which binds Tig keys to Git command aliases.
// TEST: gitconfig
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[alias]
	gitk-bg = !"gitk HEAD --not $(git rev-parse --remotes) &"
	publish = !"for i in origin public; do git push $i; done"
[tig "bind"]
	# @-prefix means that the console output will not be shown.
	generic = V !@git gitk-bg
	generic = > !git publish
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Internal user-defined commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Actions beginning with a ':' will be run and interpreted as internal commands
and act similar to commands run via Tig's prompt. Valid internal commands are
configuration file options (as described in this document) and pager view
commands. Examples:

// TEST: tigrc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Reload ~/.tigrc when 'S' is pressed
bind generic S :source .tigrc

# Change diff view to show all commit changes regardless of file limitations
bind diff F :set diff-options = --full-diff

# Show the output of git-reflog(1) in the pager view
bind generic W :!git reflog

# Search for previous diff (c)hunk and next diff header
bind stage 2 :?^@@
bind stage D :/^diff --(git|cc)

bind main I :toggle id				# Show/hide the ID column
bind diff D :toggle diff-options --minimal	# Use minimal diff algorithm
bind diff [ :toggle diff-context -3		# Decrease context (-U arg)
bind diff ] :toggle diff-context +3		# Increase context
bind generic V :toggle split-view-height -10%	# Decrease split height
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similar to external commands, pager view commands can contain variable names
that will be substituted before the command is run.

Action names
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Valid action names are described below. Note, all action names are
case-insensitive, and you may use '-', '_', and '.' interchangeably, e.g.
"view-main", "View.Main", and "VIEW_MAIN" are the same.

Color command
-------------

Color commands control highlighting and the user interface styles. If your
terminal supports color, these commands can be used to assign foreground and
background combinations to certain areas. Optionally, an attribute can be
given as the last parameter. The syntax is:

[verse]
*color* 'area' 'fgcolor' 'bgcolor' '[attributes]'

Examples:
// TEST: tigrc
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Override the default terminal colors to white on black.
color default		white	black
# Diff colors
color diff-header	yellow	default
color diff-index	blue	default
color diff-chunk	magenta	default
color "Reported-by:"	green	default
# View specific color
color tree.date		black	cyan	bold
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Or in the Git configuration files:
// TEST: gitconfig
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[tig "color"]
	# A strange looking cursor line
	cursor		= red	default underline
	# UI colors
	title-blur	= white	blue
	title-focus	= white	blue	bold
# View specific color
[tig "color.tree"]
	date		= cyan	default	bold
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Area names::

	Can be either a built-in area name or a custom quoted string. The
	latter allows custom color rules to be added for lines matching a
	quoted string.
	Valid built-in area names are described below. Note, all names are
	case-insensitive, and you may use '-', and '_' interchangeably,
	e.g. "Diff-Header" and "DIFF_HEADER" are the same.
	View specific colors can be defined by prefixing the view name to
	the area name, e.g. "stage.diff-chunk" and "diff.diff-chunk".

Color names::

	Valid colors include: *white*, *black*, *green*, *magenta*, *blue*,
	*cyan*, *yellow*, *red*, *default*. Use *default* to refer to the
	default terminal colors, for example, to keep the background
	transparent when you are using a terminal with a transparent
	background.
+
Colors can also be specified using the keywords *color0*, *color1*, ...,
*colorN-1* (where *N* is the number of colors supported by your terminal).
This is useful when you remap the colors for your display or want to enable
colors supported by 88-color and 256-color terminals. Note that the 'color'
prefix is optional. If you prefer, you can specify colors directly by their
numbers *0*, *1*, ..., *N-1* instead, just like in the configuration file of
Git.

Attribute names::

	Valid attributes include: *normal*, *blink*, *bold*, *dim*, *reverse*,
	*standout*, and *underline*. Note, not all attributes may be supported
	by the terminal.

UI colors
~~~~~~~~~

The colors and attributes to be used for the text that is not highlighted or
that specify the use of the default terminal colors can be controlled by
setting the *default* color option.

Highlighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

--

Diff markup::

Options concerning diff start, chunks and lines added and deleted.

*diff-header*, *diff-chunk*, *diff-add*, *diff-add2*, *diff-del*,
*diff-del2*

Enhanced Git diff markup::

Extra diff information emitted by the Git diff machinery, such as mode
changes, rename detection, and similarity.

*diff-oldmode*, *diff-newmode*, *diff-copy-from*, *diff-copy-to*,
*diff-similarity*, *diff-index*

Pretty print commit headers::

Commit diffs and the revision logs are usually formatted using pretty printed
headers , unless `--pretty=raw` was given. This includes lines, such as merge
info, commit ID, and author and committer date.

*pp-refs*, *pp-reflog*, *pp-reflogmsg*, *pp-merge*

Raw commit header::

Usually shown when `--pretty=raw` is given, however 'commit' is pretty much
omnipresent.

*commit*, *parent*, *tree*, *author*, *committer*

Commit message::

`Signed-off-by`, `Acked-by`, `Reviewed-by` and `Tested-by` lines are colorized.
Characters in the commit title exceeding a predefined width can be highlighted.


Tree markup::

Colors for information of the tree view.

*tree-dir*, *tree-file*

--

Source command
-------------

Source commands make it possible to read additional configuration files.
Sourced files are included in-place, meaning when a 'source' command is
encountered the file will be immediately read. Any commands later in the
current configuration file will take precedence. The syntax is:

[verse]
*source* 'path'

Examples:
// TEST: tigrc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
source ~/.tig/colorscheme.tigrc
source ~/.tig/keybindings.tigrc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
