# This completion builds upon the git completion (>= git 1.17.11),
# which most tig users should already have available at this point.
# To use these routines:
#
#    1) Copy this file to somewhere (e.g. ~/.bash_completion.d/tig).
#
#    2) Add the following line to your .bashrc:
#
#           source ~/.bash_completion.d/tig
#
#       Note that most Linux distributions source everything in
#       ~/.bash_completion.d/ automatically at bash startup, so you
#       have to source this script manually only in shells that were
#       already running before.
#
#    3) You may want to make sure the git executable is available
#       in your PATH before this script is sourced, as some caching
#       is performed while the script loads.  If git isn't found
#       at source time then all lookups will be done on demand,
#       which may be slightly slower.

#tig-completion requires __git_complete
#* If not defined, source git completions script so __git_complete is available
