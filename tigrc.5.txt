tigrc(5)
========

NAME
----
tigrc - tig configuration file


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*set*   'variable' *=* 'value'
*bind*  'keymap' 'key' 'action'
*color* 'area' 'fgcolor' 'bgcolor' '[attributes]'
*source* 'path'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

You can permanently set an option by putting it in the `~/.tigrc` file.  The
file consists of a series of 'commands'.  Each line of the file may contain
only one command.

The hash mark ('#') is used as a 'comment' character. All text after the
comment character to the end of the line is ignored. You can use comments to
annotate your initialization file.

Git configuration
-----------------

Alternatively to using `~/.tigrc`, tig options can be set by putting them in
one of the git configuration files, which are read by tig on startup. See
'git-config(1)' for which files to use. The following example show the basic
syntax to use for settings, bindings and colors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[tig] show-rev-graph = true
[tig "color"] cursor = yellow red bold 
[tig "bind"] generic = P parent
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to tig-specific options, the following git options are read from
the git configuration:

'color.*'::

	Colors for the various UI types. Can be completely disabled by setting
	'read-git-colors'.

'core.abbrev'::

	The width of the commit ID. See also 'id-width' option.

'core.editor'::

	The editor command. Can be overridden by setting GIT_EDITOR.

'core.worktree'::

	The path to the root of the working tree.

'gui.encoding'::

	The encoding to use for displaying of file content.

'i18n.commitencoding'::

	The encoding used for commits. The default is UTF-8.

Set command
-----------

A few selective variables can be configured via the set command. The syntax
is:

[verse]
*set* variables *=* value

Examples:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
set show-author = abbreviated	# Show abbreviated author names.
set show-date = relative	# Show relative commit date.
set show-rev-graph = yes	# Show revision graph?
set show-refs = yes		# Show references?
set commit-order = topo		# Order commits topologically
set read-git-colors = no	# Do not read git's color settings.
set show-line-numbers = no	# Show line numbers?
set line-number-interval = 5	# Interval between line numbers
set horizontal-scroll = 33%	# Scroll 33% of the view width
set blame-options = -C -C -C	# Blame lines from other files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Or in the git configuration files:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[tig]
	show-date = yes		# Show commit date?
	author-width = 10	# Set width of the author column
	line-graphics = no	# Disable graphics characters
	tab-size = 8		# Number of spaces per tab
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The type of variables is either bool, int, string, or mixed.

Valid bool values::

	To set a bool variable to true use either "1", "true", or "yes".
	Any other value will set the variable to false.

Valid int values::

	A non-negative integer.

Valid string values::

	A string of characters. Optionally, use either ' or " as delimiters.

Valid mixed values::

	These values are composites of the above types. The valid values are
	specified in the description.

Variables
~~~~~~~~~

The following variables can be set:

'author-width' (int)::

	Width of the author column. When set to 5 or below, the author name
	will be abbreviated to the author's initials.


'filename-width' (int)::

	Width of the filename column.

'id-width' (int)::

	Width of the commit ID. When unset tig will use the value of
	'core.abbrev' if found or default to 7.  See git-config(1) on how to
	set 'core.abbrev'.

'diff-options' (string)::

	A space separate string of diff options to use in the diff view.
	git-show(1) is used for formatting and always passes --patch-with-stat.
	This option overrides any options specified in the TIG_DIFF_OPTS
	environment variable (described in manpage:tig[1]), but is itself
	overridden by diff flags given on the command line invocation.

'blame-options' (string)::

	A space separated string of extra blame options. Can be used for
	telling git-blame(1) how to detect the origin of lines. The value
	is ignored when tig is started in blame mode and given blame options
	on the command line.

'line-graphics' (mixed) [ "ascii" | "default" | "utf-8" | bool]::

	What type of character graphics for line drawing.

'line-number-interval' (int)::

	Interval between line numbers. Note, you have to toggle on line
	numbering with ".".  The default is to number every fifth line.

'horizontal-scroll' (mixed)::

	Interval to scroll horizontally in each step. Can be specified either
	as the number of columns, e.g. '5', or as a percentage of the view
	width, e.g. '33%', where the maximum is 100%. For percentages it is
	always ensured that at least one column is scrolled. The default is to
	scroll '50%' of the view width.

'read-git-colors' (bool)::

	Whether to read git's color settings. True by default.

'show-author' (mixed) ["full", "abbreviated" | "email" | "email-user" | bool]::

	How to display author names. If set to "abbreviated" author initials
	will be shown. Can be toggled.

'show-filename' (mixed) ["auto" | "always" | bool]::

	When to display file names. If set to "auto" file names are shown
	only when needed, e.g. when running: tig blame -C <file>.

'show-date' (mixed) ["relative" | "short" | "default" | "local" | bool]::

	Whether and how to show date. If set to "relative" a relative date will be
	used, e.g. "2 minutes ago". If set to "short" no time information is
	shown. If set to "local", localtime(3) is used. Can be toggled.

'show-notes' (mixed) [note reference | bool]::

	Whether to show notes for a commit. When set to a note reference the
	reference is passed to `git show --notes=`. Notes are enabled by
	default.

'show-refs' (bool)::

	Whether to show references (branches, tags, and remotes) in the main
	view on start-up. Can be toggled.

'show-id' (bool)::

	Whether to show commit IDs in the main view. Disabled by default. Can
	be toggled. See also 'id-width' option.

'title-overflow' (mixed) [bool | int]::

	Whether to highlight text in commit titles exceeding a given width.
	When set to a boolean, it enables/disables the highlighting using the
	default width of 50 character. When set to an int, the assigned value
	is used as the maximum character width.

'show-rev-graph' (bool)::

	Whether to show revision graph in the main view on start-up.
	Can be toggled. See also line-graphics options.

'show-changes' (bool)::

	Whether to show staged and unstaged changes in the main view.
	Can be toggled.

'show-line-numbers' (bool)::

	Whether to show line numbers. Can be toggled.

'vertical-split' (bool)::

	Whether to split the view horizontally or vertically.

'split-view-height' (mixed)::

	Height of the lower view in a split view. Can be specified either as
	the number of rows, e.g. '5', or as a percentage of the view height,
	e.g. '80%', where the maximum is 100%. It is always ensured that the
	smaller of the views is at least four rows high. The default is a view
	height of '66%'.

'status-untracked-dirs' (bool)::

	Show untracked directories contents in the status view (analog to
	`git ls-files --directory` option). On by default.

'tab-size' (int)::

	Number of spaces per tab. The default is 8 spaces.

'diff-context' (int)::

	Number of context lines to show for diffs.

'ignore-space' (mixed) ["no" | "all" | "some" | "at-eol" | bool]::

    Ignore space changes in diff view. By default no space changes are ignored.
    Changing this to "all", "some" or "at-eol" is equivalent to passing
    "--ignore-all-space", "--ignore-space" or "--ignore-space-at-eol"
    respectively to `git diff` or `git show`.

'commit-order' (mixed) ["default" | "topo" | "date" | "reverse" | bool]::

	Commit ordering using the default (chronological reverse) order,
	topological order, date order or reverse order. The default order is
	used when the option is set to false, and topo order when set to true.

'ignore-case' (bool)::

	Ignore case in searches. By default, the search is case sensitive.

'wrap-lines' (bool)::

	Wrap long lines. By default, lines are not wrapped.
	Not compatible with line numbers enabled.

'focus-child' (bool)::

	Whether to focus the child view when it is opened. When disabled the
	focus will remain in the parent view, avoiding reloads of the child
	view when navigating the parent view. True by default.

'editor-line-number' (bool)::

	Whether to pass the selected line number to the editor command. The
	line number is passed as `+<line-number>` in front of the file name.
	Example: `vim +10 tig.c`

Bind command
------------

Using bind commands keys can be mapped to an action when pressed in a given
key map. The syntax is:

[verse]
*bind* 'keymap' 'key' 'action'

Examples:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A few keybindings
bind main w scroll-line-up
bind main s scroll-line-down
bind main space enter
bind diff a previous
bind diff d next
bind diff b move-first-line
# An external command to update from upstream
bind generic F !git fetch
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Or in the git configuration files:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[tig "bind"]
	# 'unbind' the default quit key binding
	main = Q none
	# Cherry-pick current commit onto current branch
	generic = C !git cherry-pick %(commit)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keys are mapped by first searching the keybindings for the current view, then
the keybindings for the *generic* keymap, and last the default keybindings.
Thus, the view keybindings shadow the generic keybindings which Shadow the
built-in keybindings.

--

Keymaps::

Valid keymaps are: *main*, *diff*, *log*, *help*, *pager*, *status*, *stage*,
*tree*, *blob*, *blame*, *branch*, and *generic*.  Use *generic* to set key
mapping in all keymaps.

Key values::

Key values should never be quoted. Use either the ASCII value or one of the
following symbolic key names. Symbolic key names are case insensitive, Use
*Hash* to bind to the `#` key, since the hash mark is used as a comment
character.

*Enter*, *Space*, *Backspace*, *Tab*, *Escape*, *Left*, *Right*, *Up*, *Down*,
*Insert*, *Delete*, *Hash*, *Home*, *End*, *PageUp*, *PageDown*, *F1*, *F2*, *F3*,
*F4*, *F5*, *F6*, *F7*, *F8*, *F9*, *F10*, *F11*, *F12*.

To add a key mapping that uses the Ctrl key, use a `^` prefix in your mapping.
For example, Ctrl-f could be mapped to *scroll-page-down* with the following line:

bind main ^f scroll-page-down


Action names::

Valid action names are described below. Note, all names are
case-insensitive, and you may use '-', '_', and '.' interchangeably,
e.g. "view-main", "View.Main", and "VIEW_MAIN" are the same.

--

Actions
~~~~~~~

Apart from the action names listed below, all actions starting with a '!' or
':' are treated specially.

Actions beginning with a ':' will run an internal tig command.  These internal
commands are those which you put in a configuration file or type at the tig
prompt.  As an example, "bind generic S :source .tigrc" will source a .tigrc
file in the current directory when 'S' is pressed.

Actions beginning with a '!' will be available as an external command. External
commands can contain variable names that will be substituted before the command
is run. Valid variable names are:

.Browsing state variables
[frame="none",grid="none",cols="25<m,75<"]
|=============================================================================
|%(head)		|The currently viewed 'head' ID. Defaults to HEAD
|%(commit)		|The currently selected commit ID.
|%(blob)		|The currently selected blob ID.
|%(branch)		|The currently selected branch name.
|%(directory)		|The current directory path in the tree view;
			 empty for the root directory.
|%(file)		|The currently selected file.
|%(ref)			|The reference given to blame or HEAD if undefined.
|%(revargs)		|The revision arguments passed on the command line.
|%(fileargs)		|The file arguments passed on the command line.
|%(diffargs)		|The diff options passed on the command line.
|%(prompt)		|Prompt for the argument value.
|%(width)		|The view width.
|=============================================================================

As an example, the following external command will save the current commit as
a patch file: "!git format-patch -1 %(commit)". If your external command
requires use of dynamic features, such as subshells, expansion of environment
variables and process control, this can be achieved by using a shell command:

.Configure a binding in ~/.tigrc to put a commit ID in the clipboard.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
bind generic I !@sh -c "echo -n %(commit) | xclip -selection c"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Or by using a combination of git aliases and tig external commands. The
following example entries can be put in either the .gitconfig or .git/config
file:

.Git configuration which binds tig keys to git command aliases.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[alias]
	gitk-bg = !"gitk HEAD --not $(git rev-parse --remotes) &"
	publish = !"for i in origin public; do git push $i; done"
[tig "bind"]
	# @-prefix means that the console output will not be shown.
	generic = V !@git gitk-bg
	generic = > !git publish
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, commands are run in the foreground with their console output
shown. For different behavior, commands can be prefixed with one or more of
the following control flags to specify how it should be executed:

.External command control flags
[frame="none",grid="none",cols="25<m,75<"]
|=============================================================================
|@			|Run the command in the background with no output.
|?			|Prompt the user before executing the command.
|<			|Exit tig after executing the command.
|=============================================================================

Control flags can be combined, e.g. "!?<git commit" will prompt whether to
execute the command and will exit tig after completion.

Color command
-------------

Color commands control highlighting and the user interface styles. If your
terminal supports color, these commands can be used to assign foreground and
background combinations to certain areas. Optionally, an attribute can be
given as the last parameter. The syntax is:

[verse]
*color* 'area' 'fgcolor' 'bgcolor' '[attributes]'

Examples:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Override the default terminal colors to white on black.
color default		white	black
# Diff colors
color diff-header	yellow	default
color diff-index	blue	default
color diff-chunk	magenta	default
color "Reported-by:"	green	default
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Or in the git configuration files:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[tig "color"]
	# A strange looking cursor line
	cursor		red	default underline
	# UI colors
	title-blur	white	blue
	title-focus	white	blue	bold
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Area names::

	Can be either a built-in area name or a custom quoted string. The
	latter allows custom color rules to be added for lines matching a
	quoted string.
	Valid built-in area names are described below. Note, all names are
	case-insensitive, and you may use '-', '_', and '.' interchangeably,
	e.g. "Diff-Header", "DIFF_HEADER", and "diff.header" are the same.

Color names::

	Valid colors include: *white*, *black*, *green*, *magenta*, *blue*,
	*cyan*, *yellow*, *red*, *default*. Use *default* to refer to the
	default terminal colors, for example, to keep the background
	transparent when you are using a terminal with a transparent
	background.
+
Colors can also be specified using the keywords *color0*, *color1*, ...,
*colorN-1* (where *N* is the number of colors supported by your terminal).
This is useful when you remap the colors for your display or want to enable
colors supported by 88-color and 256-color terminals. Note that the 'color'
prefix is optional. If you prefer, you can specify colors directly by their
numbers *0*, *1*, ..., *N-1* instead, just like in the configuration file of
Git.

Attribute names::

	Valid attributes include: *normal*, *blink*, *bold*, *dim*, *reverse*,
	*standout*, and *underline*. Note, not all attributes may be supported
	by the terminal.

UI colors
~~~~~~~~~

The colors and attributes to be used for the text that is not highlighted or
that specify the use of the default terminal colors can be controlled by
setting the *default* color option.

.General
[frame="none",grid="none",cols="25<m,75<"]
|=============================================================================
|default		|Override default terminal colors (see above).
|cursor			|The cursor line.

Highlighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

--

Diff markup::

Options concerning diff start, chunks and lines added and deleted.

*diff-header*, *diff-chunk*, *diff-add*, *diff-del*

Enhanced git diff markup::

Extra diff information emitted by the git diff machinery, such as mode
changes, rename detection, and similarity.

*diff-oldmode*, *diff-newmode*, *diff-copy-from*, *diff-copy-to*,
*diff-rename-from*, *diff-rename-to*, *diff-deleted-file-mode*,
*diff-similarity*, *diff-dissimilarity* *diff-tree*, *diff-index*, *diff-stat*

Pretty print commit headers::

Commit diffs and the revision logs are usually formatted using pretty printed
headers , unless `--pretty=raw` was given. This includes lines, such as merge
info, commit ID, and author and committer date.

*pp-author*, *pp-commit*, *pp-merge*, *pp-date*, *pp-adate*, *pp-cdate*,
*pp-refs*

Raw commit header::

Usually shown when `--pretty=raw` is given, however 'commit' is pretty much
omnipresent.

*commit*, *parent*, *tree*, *author*, *committer*

Commit message::

`Signed-off-by`, `Acked-by`, `Reviewed-by` and `Tested-by` lines are colorized.
Characters in the commit title exceeding a predefined width can be highlighted.

*signoff*, *acked*, *reviewed*, *tested*, *overflow*

Tree markup::

Colors for information of the tree view.

*tree-dir*, *tree-file*

--

Source command
-------------

Source commands make it possible to read additional configuration files.
Sourced files are included in-place, meaning when a 'source' command is
encountered the file will be immediately read. Any commands later in the
current configuration file will take precedence. The syntax is:

[verse]
*source* 'path'

Examples:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
source ~/.tig/colorscheme.tigrc
source ~/.tig/keybindings.tigrc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
