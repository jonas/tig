tig-0.18
--------

Incompatibilities:

 - Remove support for the deprecated TIG_{MAIN,DIFF,LOG,TREE,BLOB}_CMD
   environment variables.

tig-0.17
--------

Improvements:

 - Start rewrite of the revision graph renderer. Three modes are
   supported UTF-8, ncurses line graphics, and ASCII. Also, enable
   revision graph rendering by default.

Bug fixes:

 - Fix ncurses 5.8 issue by passing non-zero column size to newwin().
 - Fix opening of diffs when browsing branches.

tig-0.16.2
----------

Bug fixes:

 - Fix regression causing empty tree view.
 - Fix set_tabsize() compile error for older versions of ncurses.

tig-0.16.1
----------

Improvements:

 - Add scroll-first-col action to jump to the first column. Bound to '|'
   by default.
 - Add 'status-untracked-dirs' option to ignore unknown directories
   contents in the status view. On by default.

Bug fixes:

 - Fix problem with empty diff views when file specs were passed on the
   command line.

tig-0.16
--------

Incompatibilities:

 - Encode everything internally as UTF-8. This can affect performance,
   but should in general improve handling of character lengths etc.
   Also, to properly handle UTF-8 environments use ncurses with wide
   character support.
 - The use of TIG_{MAIN,DIFF,LOG,TREE,BLOB}_CMD environment variables
   has been deprecated. To allow configuration of the diff view,
   TIG_DIFF_OPTS can be used.

Improvements:

 - Plug several memory leaks.
 - Command line arguments are split into diff, revision, and file
   arguments and made available as %(diffargs), %(revargs), and
   %(fileargs). Diff view will limit diffs using %(fileargs).
 - Status view: update the file variable when a line is selected so
   %(file) works as expected.
 - Branch view: add %(branch) symbol providing access to the selected
   branch.
 - Branch view: add entry to browse all branches (uses git-log's --all
   flag).
 - Abbreviation of author names can now be configured and toggled.
 - Mark detached heads with [HEAD].
 - Add support for displaying dates in local time.

Bug fixes:

 - Status view: fix usage from sub directories, which was broken by the
   changes made to support blame view from sub directories.
 - Fix text expansion to not truncate long lines
 - Fix parsing of boolean show-date values.
 - Fix relative date.
 - Fix unbind to behave as if the keybinding was never defined.
 - Fix unbind to also cover built-in run requests.

   line info from the blame porcelain output added in git version 1.6.3.

tig-0.15
--------

Incompatibilities:

 - Setting the cursor color no longer automatically sets the text to
   bold. The old 'lazy' behavior was a bug.
 - Remove check for git-repo-config, which was officially deprecated in
   git version 1.5.4. The configure script no longer depends on git
   being installed.

Improvements:

 - Provide the manual as a man page named tigmanual(7).
 - Add ability to toggle between showing shorter dates (without time
   info) and relative dates. Use 'D' to toggle between date formats.
 - Show the active (instead of the default) keybindings in the help
   view. Furthermore, honor the keymap when suggesting actions in the
   help messages.
 - Add branch view for choosing which branch to display in the main
   view. Bound to 'H' by default.
 - Tree view: show entry to parent directory ('..') when running from
   subdirectory.
 - Tree view: sort entries by name, date or author. Toggling is bound to
   'i' by default, with 'I' controlling whether or not to sort in
   ascending order.
 - Make height of the lower view in a split view configurable by setting
   the 'split-view-height' variable to a number or a percentage.
   Defaults to 2/3 of the total view height.
 - Allow multiple text attributes for color commands:

	color cursor white blue underline bold

Bug fixes:

 - Blame view: fix loading of blame data when opened from the tree view
   and CWD is not the repo root. (Debian bug 540766)

 - Entering a number in the prompt will jump to that line number.
 - Handle core.worktree by setting GIT_DIR and GIT_WORK_TREE.
 - Make behavior of horizontal scrolling configurable by setting the
   'horizontal-scroll' variable to a number or a percentage. Defaults to
   scrolling 50% of the view width.

Bug fixes:

 - Status view: show error when failing to open a file.
 - Status view: report failures to update a file.
 - Blame view: fix problem with uninitialized variable.
 - Blame view: use line number information when loading blame for
   specific commit.
 - Fix handling of quoted strings in the config file.

 - Tree view: avoid flickering when updating.
 - Tree view: annotate entries with commit information.
 - Tree & blob view: open any blob in an editor.
 - Stage & main view: restore view position when reloading.
 - Blame view: load blame for parent commit. For merge commits the parent

 - Bind the maximize view action to 'O'; it conflicted with the

   and the tree, status, and stage views.
 - Blame/main view: allow display of date, author, and references to be
