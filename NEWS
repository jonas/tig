Release notes
=============

master
------

 - Tig now has its own tag on Stack Overflow, where users are invited to
   ask questions: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tig

Improvements:

 - Make tig prompt commands bindable to keys. For example:
   `bind diff F :set diff-options = --full-diff`. (GH #69, #116)
 - Add a diff-options setting for specifying default diff options.
   Example: `set diff-options = --patience`. (GH #116)
 - Add toggles for showing author email or email user names. (GH #115)
 - Open editor at the selected line by prefixing the file argument with
   `+<lineno>`. Tested in vi, vim, emacs, nano, gedit, geany. Disable
   by adding `set editor-line-number = no` to ~/.tigrc. (GH #118, #119)
 - Add toggle-files to control whether to show full commit diff or only
   the diff concerning the currently selected file, e.g. for blame.
 - Optionally highlight exceeding characters in long commit titles.
   The default title max width is 50 characters. Customize using:
   `set title-overflow = 50` (GH #125)
 - Add +ESC key bindings. Example: `bind generic ^[v move-page-up` (GH #120)

Bug fixes:

 - Reload current branch name when reloading the status view. (GH #93)
 - Fix compile errors on old Solaris. (GH #97)
 - Reload HEAD info when reloading the stage view. (GH #104, #93)
 - Fix diff view display for staged/unstaged changes when using 'd'.
 - Fix display of status messages when toggling view options. (GH #111)
 - Fix illegal memory access. (GH #98)

tig-1.1
-------

Incompatibilities:

 - Disable diff move/copy detection by default, boosting diff
   performance on larger projects. Use git config 'diff.renames' option
   (git-wide) to set your preferred behavior. Environment variable
   TIG_DIFF_OPTS can be used to restore the old behavior.
 - Fix manual keybinging for stage-single-line. (GH #108)
 - Values set for author-width and filename-width will result in widths
   one character bigger than previously.

Improvements:

 - Typing a text in the prompt will be interpreted as a tig command.
   Prefixing the command with a '!' will execute this system command in
   an external pager. Entering a single key will execute the
   corresponding key binding.
 - Basic support for wrapping long line in pager, diff, and stage views.
   Enable using: `set wrap-lines = yes`. (GH #2)
 - User-defined commands prefixed with a '?' means prompt before
   execution. Example: `bind main B !?git rebase -i %(commit)`.
 - User-defined commands prefixed with a '<' means exit after execution.
   Example: `bind main C !<git commit`. (GH #66)
 - User-defined commands are executed unquoted to support shell commands.
   Example: `bind generic I !@sh -c "echo -n %(commit) | xclip -selection c"`.
   (GH #65)
 - Configure case-insensitive searches using: `set ignore-case = yes`.
 - Add "deleted mode" line type for better diff coloring.
 - Open editor when requesting edit action from within a file diff.
 - Update AX_WITH_CURSES to build under Cygwin.
 - Improve tigrc(5) documentation. (Debian #682766)
 - Allow to build on Mac OS 10.7 without the configure script. (GH #25)
 - Add option to split the view vertically instead of horizontally.
   Example: `set vertical-split = yes'. (GH #76)
 - Add 'show-id' and 'id-width' options to configure the display of
   commit IDs in the main view and ID width in the blame view. (GH #77)
 - Allow to override git-based encoding to UTF-8 by setting
   'i18n.commitencoding' or 'gui.encoding'.
 - Improve autobuild support to track generated files and work with
   autoreconf 2.61.
 - Commit IDs are read from stdin when --stdin is given; works for main
   and diff view, e.g. `tig --no-walk --stdin < cherry-picks.txt`.
 - Add option to disable focusing of the child view when it's opened.
   Disable using: `set focus-child = no`. (GH #83)
 - Allow to open blob related with added content in a diff. (GH #91)

Bug fixes:

 - Fix commit graph regression when a path spec is specified. (GH #53)
 - Main view: only show staged/unstaged changes for the current branch.
 - Support submodules created with current version of git. (GH #54)
 - Fix diff status message for file diffs with no content changes.
 - Fix parent blaming when tig is launched in subdirectory. (GH #70)
 - Do not show deleted branch when reloading the branch view.

-------

The master repository is git://github.com/jonas/tig.git, and the old
master repository (http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/tig.git) will be retired.

   supported UTF-8, ncurses line graphics, and ASCII. Also, enable
   revision graph rendering by default.

Bug fixes:

 - Fix ncurses 5.8 issue by passing non-zero column size to newwin().
 - Fix opening of diffs when browsing branches.

tig-0.16.2
----------

Bug fixes:

   but should in general improve handling of character lengths etc.
   Also, to properly handle UTF-8 environments use ncurses with wide
   character support.
 - The use of TIG_{MAIN,DIFF,LOG,TREE,BLOB}_CMD environment variables
   has been deprecated. To allow configuration of the diff view,
   TIG_DIFF_OPTS can be used.

Improvements:

 - Plug several memory leaks.
 - Command line arguments are split into diff, revision, and file
   arguments and made available as %(diffargs), %(revargs), and
   %(fileargs). Diff view will limit diffs using %(fileargs).

   %(file) works as expected.
 - Branch view: add %(branch) symbol providing access to the selected
   branch.

   line info from the blame porcelain output added in git version 1.6.3.

tig-0.15
--------

Incompatibilities:

 - Setting the cursor color no longer automatically sets the text to
   bold. The old 'lazy' behavior was a bug.
 - Remove check for git-repo-config, which was officially deprecated in
   git version 1.5.4. The configure script no longer depends on git
   being installed.

Improvements:

 - Provide the manual as a man page named tigmanual(7).
 - Add ability to toggle between showing shorter dates (without time
   info) and relative dates. Use 'D' to toggle between date formats.

   the 'split-view-height' variable to a number or a percentage.
   Defaults to 2/3 of the total view height.
 - Allow multiple text attributes for color commands:

	color cursor white blue underline bold

Bug fixes:

 - Blame view: fix loading of blame data when opened from the tree view
   and CWD is not the repo root. (Debian bug 540766)

   'horizontal-scroll' variable to a number or a percentage. Defaults to
   scrolling 50% of the view width.

Bug fixes:

 - Status view: show error when failing to open a file.
 - Status view: report failures to update a file.
 - Blame view: fix problem with uninitialized variable.
 - Blame view: use line number information when loading blame for
   specific commit.
