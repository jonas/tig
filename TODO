Features that should be explored.

Before tig-1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Better text-input support.

    - Add an edit keymap so the "editor" can be customized.
    - Allow the cursor to navigate in the input area.

 - Wrap long lines to reduce horizontal scrolling.

 - Rewrite revgraph handling.

   The commit structure should be expanded to have a parent member,
   which points to the parent commits.

    - Make main view support navigating the revision graph using the
      parent action.

    - Color the revgraph to make it easier to follow branches.

   Other revgraph improvements:

    - Show from which branch heads and tags a commit is reachable, and
      perhaps which tag is the latest among the ones reachable from
      that commit, as part of the diff view. How should rewritten parent
      information be handled? Depends on new enhanced commit structure.

Long term goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Add a commit cache.

   Many views use commit information and load it into their own custom
   data structure. Having the information shared would make it easier to
   do various interesting stuff across the views.

 - Split sources of tig.c into multiple files.
